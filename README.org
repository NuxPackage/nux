* Nux, a wrapper over nix-env written in rust. *BETA SOFTWARE*
** Why?
Nux simplies the complicated sturcture with nix, and nix-env. This project is inspired by projects like /hey/ from hlissner's nix dotfiles. Unlike simple wrappers, like /hey/, it provides a progress bar and some other nice features
